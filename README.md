# Color-Detection-in-Python
Color detection is an activity for detecting the names of any colors. So, for humans this activity is an extremely easy action but for computers, it is not impossible but a difficult task. Well, a human eye and brain works together to interpret colors of any kind of objects and translate light into color. Light diaphragms that are present in a human eye transmit the signal to the brain. And the brain then recognizes the color. In this color detection project, we are going to write a program through which it can automatically get the name of the color by double clicking on the image that will be uploaded. And then, we will have a data file that contains the color names and its values i.e. will be in RGB values or hex code.
